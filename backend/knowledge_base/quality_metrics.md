# Quality Metrics

## Code Quality Metrics
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measure code complexity (target: <10 per function)
- **Lines of Code**: Monitor function and class size (target: <50 lines per function)
- **Code Duplication**: Identify and eliminate duplicate code
- **Technical Debt**: Track code quality issues and their resolution
- **Code Coverage**: Measure test coverage (target: >80% for critical paths)

## Test Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Test Execution Time**: Fast feedback loop (target: <30 seconds for unit tests)
- **Test Reliability**: Flaky test detection and elimination
- **Test Maintainability**: Ease of updating tests when code changes
- **Test Value**: Business value of test scenarios

## Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: API endpoint response times (target: p95 <200ms)
- **Throughput**: Requests per second the system can handle
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and disk utilization
- **Scalability**: Performance under increasing load
- **Bottlenecks**: Identification of performance limiting factors

## Reliability Metrics
- **Uptime**: System availability percentage (target: >99.5%)
