## üîç **Analysis**

### **UI/UX Detection Challenges**
- **False Positive**: "Create a design system" ‚Üí Architect (6.3% confidence)
- **Root Cause**: "design" keyword has high weight in architect mode
- **Solution**: Enhanced keyword specificity and context analysis

### **Strengths**
- **Developer**: Perfect detection due to clear technical keywords
- **Architect**: Excellent at system-level design tasks
- **QA**: Strong at testing and validation terminology
- **DevOps**: Consistent with infrastructure and deployment terms

### **Improvement Areas**
- **Context Awareness**: Better understanding of task intent vs. keyword overlap
- **Confidence Calibration**: More nuanced confidence scoring
- **Fallback Logic**: Smarter default mode selection

## üìà **Continuous Improvement**

### **Monthly Evaluation**
- Run full evaluation set monthly
- Track accuracy trends over time
- Identify new edge cases and patterns

### **Feedback Loop**
- Collect user feedback on mode detection
- Adjust keyword weights based on usage
- Refine confidence thresholds

### **A/B Testing**
- Test new detection algorithms
- Compare performance metrics
- Validate improvements before deployment
