# Trading System Documentation

This document compiles the core components, analytics, and numerical guidelines of your SPX/SPY-focused trading system. It is structured to be used both as a quick reference for you and as input for an AI "copilot" to automate or assist with analysis. The emphasis is strictly on the quantitative and procedural aspects you have shared, without extraneous commentary.

## 1. System Overview
- **Primary Universe:** SPX (S&P 500 Index) via weekly/daily/1-hourly options (SPXW).
- **Timeframes:**
  - Intraday: 1 min, 3 min, 10 min, 30 min
  - Daily: Candle close & ATR pivots
  - Weekly: Trend confirmation, gap analysis
- **Core Philosophy:**
  - Combine flow-driven context (gamma exposure, institutional block activity) with technical structure (EMA/Ribbon, ATR pivot levels, Phase Oscillator).
  - Use probability-based filters (ATR hit-rates, Golden Gate completion stats by hour).
  - Focus on capital preservation—only trade high-probability signals, cut losses quickly if setup fails.

## 2. Key Indicators & Analytics

### 2.1 ATR Levels & Probability Bands
- **Definition:**
  - ATR Levels are dynamic horizontal pivots based on the current ATR (Average True Range) of SPX.
  - They mark significant probability thresholds for potential mean-reversion or trend continuation.
- **Day-Mode ATR Levels (Daily ATR ≈ 105–110 pts):**
  - 0% Level: Yesterday's close (reference).
  - +23.6% ATR (≈ +24 pts) → Bullish/Long Trigger (≈ +1 ATR of upper range).
  - +38.2% ATR (≈ +40 pts) → Golden Gate (GG) "Mid-Range".
  - +61.8% ATR (≈ +65 pts) → "GM" (Golden Gate Completion/Next Target).
  - +100% ATR (≈ +105 pts) → Upper Daily Extreme / Possible "VOMY" entry rejection zone.
  - +123.6%, +138.2%, +161.8%, +178.6%, +200% ATR → Rare "extended move" zones (∼0.7% chance to hit +2 ATR in a day).
  - −23.6% ATR (≈ −24 pts) → Bearish/Short Trigger.
  - −38.2% ATR (≈ −40 pts) → Bearish Golden Gate (iGG).
  - −61.8% ATR (≈ −65 pts) → Lower Mid-Range.
  - −100% ATR (≈ −105 pts) → Lower Extreme / "VOMY Bottom".
- **Multi-Day & Long-Term ATR Levels:**
  - +1 ATR Daily: (~ +105 pts on SPX) → +1 ATR target from prior close (≈ 6015).
  - −1 ATR Daily: (~ −105 pts on SPX) → −1 ATR from prior close (≈ 5745).
  - Yearly ATR Bands:
    - "Long > 6031.65" → If SPX closes above 6031.65 (2014 yearly pivot + ATR), bull case dominating.
    - "Short < 5731.61" → If SPX closes below 5731.61, bearish case likely.
- **Usage:**
  - Day within Day (0–24 hours):
    - 23.6% ATR zone → ~80% chance of hitting "Mid-Range" in a single trading day.
    - 61.8% ATR → ~64% chance (Golden Gate entrant, best risk/reward).
    - 100% ATR → ~14% chance (extreme move, often fades).
  - Multi-Day within Week (1–5 days):
    - Probability increases when looking at a 5-day window; e.g., +1 ATR has ~56% probability within the same week, +2 ATR ~0.7%.
  - Swing/Position (1–3 weeks, 1–3 months):
    - Daily ATR pivots become weekly pivots (confluence with weekly EMA cross).
    - Yearly ATR pivot (~5731.61) acts as a strong structural pivot for multi-month targets.
- **Historical Hit-Rates (Day-Mode, SPX):**
  - From Trigger to Completion (Same Day):

| Trigger Hour (EST) | Completion % During Remaining Hours | Did/Didn't Complete |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 9:30 (Open)        | 63.82%                              | 63.82% Completed, 36.18% Didn't |
| 10:00              | 56.99%                              | 56.99% Completed, 43.01% Didn't |
| 11:00              | 54.09%                              | 54.09% Completed, 45.91% Didn't |
| 12:00              | 51.20%                              | 51.20% Completed, 48.80% Didn't |
| 13:00              | 49.04%                              | 49.04% Completed, 50.96% Didn't |
| 14:00              | 44.85%                              | 44.85% Completed, 55.15% Didn't |
| 15:00              | 23.36%                              | 23.36% Completed, 76.64% Didn't |

- **Bearish Golden Gate (iGG) Day-Mode Completion Rates:**

| Trigger Hour | Completion % (Bear) | Didn't Complete |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 9:30 (Open)  | 81.30%              | 18.70%          |
| 10:00        | 69.67%              | 30.33%          |
| 11:00        | 58.76%              | 41.24%          |
| 12:00        | 48.57%              | 51.43%          |
| 13:00        | 36.62%              | 63.38%          |
| 14:00        | 22.86%              | 77.14%          |
| 15:00        | 6.54%               | 93.46%          |

- **Interpretation:**
  - A Bullish GG triggered between 9 am–10 am has ~80–90% same-day completion. After 1 pm, the hit-rate falls below 50%.
  - A Bearish GG has very high completion rate (> 80%) if it prints at open, but drops to < 40% by 1 pm.

### 2.2 Golden Gate (GG) Setups
- **Definition:**
  - A Golden Gate (GG) is a specific price move from the prior pivot to a Fibonacci/ATR level, typically the +38.2% ATR to +61.8% ATR zone (for bullish) or −38.2% ATR to −61.8% ATR zone (for bearish).
  - It implies a "mid-range" entry in an existing trending or directional move, where odds favor continuation to the next ATR pivot.
- **Trigger Conditions:**
  - Bullish GG: SPX crosses above the +38.2% ATR level (≈ prior close + 40 points) after a clear down-to-up structure or consolidation in a bullish ribbon environment.
  - Bearish GG: SPX crosses below the −38.2% ATR level (≈ prior close − 40 points) after a clear up-to-down structure or consolidation under a bearish ribbon environment.
- **Completion Targets:**
  - From +38.2% ATR to +61.8% ATR (≈ +40 → +65 points from prior close).
  - From −38.2% ATR to −61.8% ATR (≈ −40 → −65 points from prior close).
- **Timing & Probability Matrix (Summarized):**
  - Trigger Hour & Same-Day Completion (reproduced from Section 2.1 for quick reference):
    - 9:30 am ET: ~64% (Bull) / ~81% (Bear)
    - 10:00 am ET: ~57% (Bull) / ~70% (Bear)
    - 11:00 am ET: ~54% (Bull) / ~59% (Bear)
    - 12:00 pm ET: ~51% (Bull) / ~48% (Bear)
    - 1:00 pm ET:  ~49% (Bull) / ~36% (Bear)
    - 2:00 pm ET: ~45% (Bull) / ~23% (Bear)
    - 3:00 pm ET: ~23% (Bull) / ~6.5% (Bear)
- **"Vomy" / "iVomy" Relationship:**
  - A GG is often accompanied by a multi-EMA cross in the ribbon (8→13→21).
  - A "Vomy" (downside reversal) triggers when multiple EMAs give way after a bullish spine (green ribbon), then a swift break of 21 EMA.
  - An "iVomy" (upside reversal) is the inverse: multiple EMAs cross up after a bearish ribbon.
  - GGs and Vomy setups often coincide: if you get a GG in the direction of the ribbon, it typically completes with high probability (especially early in the session).
